# Core

Developh Core members officially assume various roles in producing content, assisting in marketing and promotions, representing the organization as ambassadors in events and delegations, and executing and delegating events. They serve as the driving force behind the organization.

Being a core member is a good way to get started on placing yourself in the inner workings behind our organization. It's generally low-commitment with a variety of tasks you can take on. You have the opportunity to attend events and meetings while representing the organization. Depending on your skillset, you might find yourself helping with graphics, coming up with workshops, strategizing logistics and campaigns, or even being the backbone behind upcoming projects.

## We're thinking of someone who...
* Has previous interest or is passionate about technology, equality, and advocacy
* Is excited and engaged, can be responsive
* Interested in creation, be it through programming, media, or any other tech-related medium

## Interested?
To apply as a Core member, please send us a *resume and a letter of intent* (the latter may be included in the body of your email) to jobs@developh.org.

The opportunity is available to all high school or college-aged students with a consistent internet connection, able to work remotely at least 1-3 hours for at least _two weeks of the month_.
