## Some things you have to know about our team culture
Just for transparency's sake.
We work around a lot of chats and on occasion, voice meetings. Lots of moving parts so it's recommended that you have some knowledge of Google Suite, workflow tools (Notion/Asana), and can work your way around tech terms. We use chat and email as heavy communication channels, so it's suggested that you're responsive on those ends.

We're spontaneous and throw lots of ideas around and do our best to make them happen. We regard one another as equals, valuing ideas and projects from every core member and allowing one another to give a go at the work we do. Transparency, honesty, and communication is key. At the end of it, we're still a student group with huge goals at making the world a better place -- we'll fail a lot which is okay, but only if we learn from those failures and strive to help one another out. We understand each other's circumstances, the diversity in each other's backgrounds and perspectives, and are welcome and open. Also we're pretty liberal and do not tolerate discrimination or fascism.
