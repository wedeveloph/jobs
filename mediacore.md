# Media Officers

Media Officers are core members that focus on designing pubmats, promotional, and marketing material for Developh's events, projects, and posts. They work under the Vice President of Marketing to help establish the branding and identity of the nonprofit. They may also be assigned to help format and layout materials for DevEd.

We encourage media officers to share their specialties and what fields of multimedia they're interested in learning so we can better delegate tasks so that we can help you expand your skills! Our Media Officers can contribute from graphic design, typography, illustrations, video editing, motion graphics, web design (visual mockups), layouting and print design, and the like. A lot of our work centers around effective and empathetic visual representation.

## We're thinking of someone who...
* Has previous interest or is passionate about technology, equality, and advocacy
* Shows proficiency in at least one "multimedia skill", willing to engage further in their specialty and possibly explore more fields
* Can work independently _and_ with a team, willing to engage in design reviews and critiques
* Interested in branding, visual identity, and effectively communicating with people

## Interested?
To apply as a Core member specializing in the Media Officer position, please send us *samples of your work (as much as you'd like, either a formal portfolio or just attaching files is fine!), a resume, and a letter of intent* (the latter may be included in the body of your email) to jobs@developh.org.

The opportunity is available to all high school or college-aged students with a consistent internet connection, able to produce a reasonable amount of outputs per month, open to remote work. Media Officers will be compensated per output in lieu of the monthly stipend. Design reviews, briefs, and meetings will be involved.
