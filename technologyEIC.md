# Technology.ph Editor-in-Chief

The Technology.ph Editor-in-Chief will be in charge of managing and scouting material for publication on the Technology.ph website, strategizing campaigns to expand reach and impact across social platforms and newsletter, and will help build the publication up.

Technology.ph is Developh's digital publication, highlighting real technology ideas and movements from the Philippines and beyond. 

## We're thinking of someone who...
* Passionate about technology (or maybe has a love-hate relationship with it) and innovation
* Has leadership experience in publishing and editing, whether for a school newspaper or a literary journal or something in between
* Is relatively familiar and up-to-date with technology journalism and news, and is excited in maximizing the Technology.ph brand as an arm of Developh


## Interested?
To apply as the Technology.ph Editor-in-Chief, please send us a *resume, writing/publication sample, and a letter of intent* (the latter may be included in the body of your email) to jobs@developh.org.

The opportunity is available to all high school or college-aged students with a consistent internet connection, preferably based in the Philippines and able to work remotely at least 3-6 hours a week. You will be expected to report to meetings and work with the core team of the nonprofit. This is a paid leadership position.
